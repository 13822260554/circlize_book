**circlize** provides complete freedom for users to design their own graphics
by implementing the self-defined function `panel.fun`. However one drawback
arises that **circlize** is completely blind to users' data so that one
important thing is missing for the visualization which is the legend.

Although legends cannot be automatically generated by **circlize**, by using
functionality from other R packages, it is just a few more lines to really
implement it. Here I will demonstrate how to customize legends and arrange to
the circular plot.

As an example, a circular plot which contains two tracks and links inside the
circle is generated. The first track will have a legend that contains points,
the second track will have a legend that contains lines, and the links
correspond to a continuous color mapping. The code is wrapped into a function
so that it can be used repeatedly.


```r
library(circlize)

col_fun = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c("green", "yellow", "red"))
circlize_plot = function() {
    set.seed(12345)
    fa = letters[1:10]
    circos.initialize(fa, xlim = c(0, 1))
    circos.track(ylim = c(0, 1), panel.fun = function(x, y) {
        circos.points(runif(20), runif(20), cex = 0.5, pch = 16, col = 2)
        circos.points(runif(20), runif(20), cex = 0.5, pch = 16, col = 3)
    })
    circos.track(ylim = c(0, 1), panel.fun = function(x, y) {
        circos.lines(sort(runif(20)), runif(20), col = 4)
        circos.lines(sort(runif(20)), runif(20), col = 5)
    })

    for(i in 1:10) {
        circos.link(sample(fa, 1), sort(runif(10))[1:2], 
                    sample(fa, 1), sort(runif(10))[1:2],
                    col = add_transparency(col_fun(rnorm(1))))
    }
    circos.clear()
}
```

In **ComplexHeatmap** package with version higher than 1.13.2, there is a
`Legend()` function which customizes legends with various styles. In following
code, legends for the two tracks and links are constructed. In the end the
three legends are packed vertically by `packLegend()`. For more detailed usage
of `Legend()` and `packLegend()`, please refer to their help pages.
